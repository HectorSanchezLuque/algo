Todd Howard's autobiography, Memoirs of a God-Genius: It Just Works, 
supposedly grants mortals who read its pages either Cheesy, 
exploit-ridden powers or a dreadful curse to never be interesting again.
Whether that is because Todd cannot create anything that is not Cheesy,
or because any who encounter his genius become doomed to create as he did, is not known.
